## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Server Selection Bug (Resolved)
- **Issue**: "it detechted wrong server everything else is good tho"
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate `get_best_server()` calls causing inconsistent server selection
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed duplicate server selection calls in backend
  - Added `preferred_server_id` parameter throughout testing pipeline
  - Implemented manual server selection with search and filtering
  - Added server distance and location display

### Export System (Tested)
- **PDF Export**: Successfully generating comprehensive PDF reports with ReportLab
- **DOCX Export**: Working Word document generation with python-docx
- **Chart Integration**: Matplotlib charts embedded in exported documents
